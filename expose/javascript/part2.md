1. it prints 3 since i iterate the length of prices times.
2. it prints 150 since it is calculated based on the value of last element in the array prices.
3. it prints 150 since it will round up 15000 to nearest integer and then divided it by 100
4. it returns [ 50, 100, 150 ] since this function calculate the discount price of each element in the array, in this case by 50% percent
5. it returns a error since it is out of scope for variable declared with let keyword
6. it returns a error since it is out of scope for variable declared with let keyword
7. it returns 150 since this time the finalPrice is in the scope of the variable declared with let keyword
8. it returns [ 50, 100, 150 ] since there is no variable that is used out of scope even though all with let variable
9. it returns a error since it is out of scope for variable declared with let keyword
10. it prints 3 since this console.log() is in the same scope of const length
11. it returns [ 50, 100, 150 ] since all of the variable is in the scope and the function will calculate 0.5 discount for all of the elements in the array.
12. 
- A. student['name'] 
- B. student['Grad Year']
- C. student.greeting()
- D. student['Favorite Teacher']['name']
- E. student['courseLoad'][0]
13. 
- A. 32 since 2 maps to '2'
- B. 1 since '3' maps to 3
- C. 3 since null maps to 0
- D. 3null since null maps to 'null'
- E. 4 since true maps to 1
- F. 0 since false maps to 0 and null maps to 0
- G. 3undefined since undefined maps to 'undefined'
- H. NaN since there is no way of mapping that can convert this into a feasible calculations
14. 
- A. true since '2' maps to 2
- B. false because it compare the string by ascii number
- C. true because '2' maps to 2
- D. false because we have two different data type
- E. false because true maps to 1
- F. true because 2 converts to Boolean is true as it is not 0
15. '==' can convert datatypes to make comparison, while '===' will compare the datatype between two variable.
16. answer in part2-question16.js
17. it will return [2,4,6] since for each elements we call doSomething() n them which is x*2
18. answer in part2-question18.js
19. it will
